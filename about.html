        <p>Link served as a Knight of Hyrule before the Calamity just over 100 years ago.
            </p>
           <p> On his journey to rescue Princess Zelda, he learned everything he could about wild food and cooking with local forage.</p>

        <p>This restaurant has been hand-built here in Hateno village, where Link not only cooks for his neighbors and any wandering adventurers, but also teaches new chefs how to use sustainably-sourced ingredients in all of their cooking.</p>

<p>Occasionally, there will be events in Tarrey Town and Lurelin Village in which a pop-up version of this restaurant will be featured. Check our directions page for event information!  </p>
