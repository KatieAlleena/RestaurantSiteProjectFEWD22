# RestaurantSiteProjectFEWD22
A project to create a website for a made up Zelda-themed restaurant completed for class. (FEWD Summer '22)

Ideas:
Follow project instructions, of course. Theme made up restaurant around Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's cooking system and use game assets and/or fanart to decorate pages. On about page use recipes from irl cookbook which covers most of the game recipes and embed a video from YT that covers a video about a recipe, maybe.
Contact page reference Sheikah Slate and/or Rito mail (from Wind Waker) and use Link's address in Hateno maybe for fan mail? IDK. This is difficult for that setting. Maybe use a fake mailto: link and fake social media? Add more in game screenshots or fanart of cooking.
Directions is difficult...use in game map and pick a town. Add screenshots from the game if possible (take own screenshots on Switch/upload via twitter maybe in order to save space. If not direct download the batch.)
Background should be maybe Sheikah slate pattern, but edit in Photoshop to be less jarring. *
