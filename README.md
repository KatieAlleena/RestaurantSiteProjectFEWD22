# RestaurantSiteProjectFEWD22
A project to create a website for a made up Zelda-themed restaurant completed for class. (FEWD Summer '22)

Ideas:
Follow project instructions, of course. Theme made up restaurant around Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's cooking system and use game assets and/or fanart to decorate pages. On about page use recipes from irl cookbook which covers most of the game recipes and embed a video from YT that covers a video about a recipe, maybe.
Contact page reference Sheikah Slate and/or Rito mail (from Wind Waker) and use Link's address in Hateno maybe for fan mail? IDK. This is difficult for that setting. Maybe use a fake mailto: link and fake social media? Add more in game screenshots or fanart of cooking.
Directions is difficult...use in game map and pick a town. Add screenshots from the game if possible (take own screenshots on Switch/upload via twitter maybe in order to save space. If not direct download the batch.)
Background should be maybe Sheikah slate pattern, but edit in Photoshop to be less jarring.

Restaurant title: Chef of the Wild
