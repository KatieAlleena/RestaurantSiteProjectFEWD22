        <h1>Directions to the Restaurant</h1>
        <p>Have no fear! We're located in Eastern Necluda. </p>
        <p>Take the opposite road at Kakariko Bridge, and follow that through
            Fort Hateno. After that, the road leads around the Cliffs of Quince. Watch out for Bokoblins on your way. When you've passed through Midla & Ginner woods, you're almost there. A short walk later and you'll see our village gates. Your new favorite restaurant will be on your right as you walk in.  </p>
